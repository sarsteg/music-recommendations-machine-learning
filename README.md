# Music Recommendations

The purpose of this project is to create a machine-learning algorithm that provides music recommendations. 

In this project we used a Spotify API to pull data, we also aquired CSVs to compile and train an algorithm to provide a song recommendations. In the file Song_Reccomendation.ipynb is the code for the recommendations. 
The folder named Cleaning-Exploration is where we explored and cleaned our data. The folder named Data houses our primary CSVs and lastly the file titled music_reccomendations_arf.ipynb provided a foundation for our algorithm to function provide recommendations.
