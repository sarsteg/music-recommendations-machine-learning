# Music Recommendations

The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that provides music recommendations. 

In this project we used a Spotify API to pull data, we also aquired CSVs to compile and train an algorithm to out put a song reccomendation. In the file Song_Reccomendation.ipynb is the code for the reccomendations. 
The folder named Cleaning-Exploration is where we explored and cleaned our data. The folder named Data houses our primary CSVs and lastly the file titled music_reccomendations_arf.ipynb provided a foundation for our algorithm to function give reccomendations. 

### Data Source

Data was aquired from Kaggle.com: [https://www.kaggle.com/code/vatsalmavani/music-recommendation-system-using-spotify-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/vatsalmavani/music-recommendation-system-using-spotify-dataset).
